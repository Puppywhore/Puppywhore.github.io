She closed her computer and looked at her reflection in the mirror. She could see that short black hair that was just long enough to be annoying for her eyes.

Maybe she is just pretending to be smart? <br/> The thought seemed to simply stick in her mind, unable to get out. It was so weird. No matter how much she tried the idea that the only reason people thought she was smart was because she knew lots and lots of small pieces of trivia she could spew in the face of people who asked. She hadn't even managed to write that essay. She sighed as the class wrapped up.</p>\r\n    }else if(quizChoice === \"false\"){\r\n        return <p className=\"text-light\">Kathrine couldn't help but feel rather superior.

It was surprisingly humiliating, but she didn't give in. Instead, she took a deep breath and tried again. The next answer was also wrong, and as she kept on choosing she felt like she couldn't get any of them right.<br/> She gritted her teeth as she  tried over and over again, every single answer wrong .<br/> When the class ended she sighed in frustration. She wanted to flip the table she was sitting at, but decided against it.</p>\r\n    }else if(quizChoice === \"true\"){\r\n        return <p className=\"text-light\">The questions weren't really that hard. After all, Kathrine was quite a clever girl. She blazed through every single one of them, seeing her name slowly rise to the top of the scoreboard. The raven-haired girl couldn't help but feel a smug sense of superiority. Her thumbs moving even faster now that the victory was at hand. She was fast, faster than she would have thought possible, and she couldn't help but imagine herself as the flash, thinking and reacting faster than lightning. She was on fire and as she won she would be carried out by her fellow students, all of them cheering and laughing at her amazing victory. <br/> While the idea was amazing it didn't go quite as planned. She did win, and the feeling in her stomach was nice, but there was no eager crowd, nor anyone to carry her through the school's halls. </p>\r\n    }else{\r\n        return <h1 className=\"text-danger\">SOMETHING BROKE!
