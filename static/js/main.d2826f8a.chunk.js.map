The raven-haired girl had a hard time figuring out what was happening in her life. Everything seemed to have... stopped. It was like this ever since she had gotten a job next to her studies.  She closed her computer and looked at her reflection in the mirror. She could see that short black hair that was just long enough to be annoying for her eyes. The petite and slender body, that meant that if she wore baggy clothing she would usually be mistaken for a boy, which she blamed her small breasts for. </p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img className=\"img-fluid rounded\" src={require(\"../../resources/kathrine.jpg\")} alt=\"Kathrine\"/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">Kathrine didn't hate her body... she simply disliked it.

The pen glowed for a second and then the light faded, leaving behind nothing but dust in Kathrine's hands. She sighed. She had the opportunity to change the world to whatever she had desired, but instead, she destroyed her only chance for adventure.

A smile spread from ear to ear as she quickly got dressed. The school uniform was the usual stuff. A shirt, skirt, stockings, bra and panties. She looked over the bra. The little label on it proudly proclaimed it to be a <span onClick={()=>action({bigBreasts:!rules.bigBreasts})} className=\"text-weight-bold text-danger Hand\">{rules.bigBreasts ? \"DD-cup\":\"B-cup\"}</span>.

Her Mother had always been a bit of a slag. The newspaper had been opened next to the plate with food. The headline proudly proclaiming:</p>\r\n<div className=\"bg-secondary\"><h5 className=\"text-light text-center text-weight-bold\">New study finds libido in women <span onClick={()=>action({libidoIncreased:!rules.libidoIncreased,skema:[\r\n    {...rules.skema[0], class: \"Sexual control\",\r\n    classChange: false,\r\n    teacher: \"Miss Peach\",\r\n    teacherChange: true,\r\n    },\r\n    {...rules.skema[1], class: \"Physical Exercise\",\r\n    classChange: false,\r\n    teacher: \"Madam Green\",\r\n    teacherChange: true,\r\n    },\r\n    {...rules.skema[2], class: \"Sexual Etiquette\",\r\n    classChange: false,\r\n    teacher: \"Miss Janny\",\r\n    teacherChange: true\r\n    },\r\n    {...rules.skema[3],class: \"Science\",\r\n    classChange: false,\r\n    teacher: \"Professor Rack\",\r\n    teacherChange: true\r\n    },\r\n]})} className=\"text-weight-bold text-danger Hand\">{rules.libidoIncreased ? \"ten times greater\":\"equal\"}</span> to that of men</h5></div>\r\n<p className=\"text-light\">At the bottom of the page were small notes with who had been married in the local area. <span className=\"Hand text-danger text-weight-bold\" onClick={()=>action({incest:!rules.incest})}>{rules.incest ? \"Her own name, paired with that of her mother's,\":\"A couple of names\"}</span> sprang to mind when reading the page.</p>\r\n\r\n    </div>)\r\n}\r\nexport default Text;","import React from \"react\";\r\nconst Text = (props) =>{\r\n    const {rules} = props\r\n    let standardText = null;\r\n    if(rules.incest){\r\n        if(rules.libidoIncreased){\r\n\r\n        standardText=\r\n        <div> \r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">Kathrine was quite proud of the changes. After all, there was no need to have a reality-altering pen if she didn't put it to use and see its limits. Thus she had to admit that it came as a surprise when a wave of energy rippled throughout the universe and the entire world seemed to stop for a second as if the changes that she had caused was so intense that it needed additional calculations. <br/> </p>\r\n        { rules.bigBreasts ? \r\n            <div>\r\n                <p className=\"text-light\"> Kathrine felt a wave of pleasure rush through her.

As they did so did her hips and ass, becoming bigger and fuller with each passing second. She could feel the overwhelming pleasure that started to spread through. However, as the pleasure spread so did an intense need. She could feel it between her legs. She needed something inside of her. She needed to be filled. She craved to get pumped hard in an endless stream of pleasure.<br/> As her body changed so did her outfit. It was quite pleasant if she had to be honest. The way that her former outfit started to fit ever so tightly around her body was something she hadn't experienced before, hugging her now-massive curves.

She pauses, didn't she use to take the bus? Something deep inside of her tells her that she has always ridden her bike to school. But Kathrine's brain knows that isn't true. It must be the effect of the pen, so she guesses that she should try and find her bike. When she does she can't help but pause. On the seat is a massive dildo planted. It is floppy and bouncy for sure, but Kathrine is embarrassed to admit that it looks well used. She sighs, there is no point in trying to resist it.

She had a distinct feeling that she held the power to destroy the entire world.

A certain heat starts to appear in her nipples, slowly building faster and faster. The raven-haired woman can feel herself start to swell up. It isn't just her tits that are growing to an admittedly impressive size, but the heat spreads between her legs. Her hips swell up, becoming wide and thick, her entire adjusting so her new bust won't look out of place. As the transformations stop she can't help but take a look at herself. She is gorgeous and someone she would absolutely kill for.</p>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <img src={require(\"../../resources/newLook.png\")} alt=\"Large breasts\" className=\"img-fluid rounded\"/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <p className=\"text-light\">However, the burning need between her thighs hasn't stopped. She is craving something inside of her so badly. She is so desperate to start touching herself. But it would be wrong with her Mother around. </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                :\r\n                <p className=\"text-light\">She can suddenly feel an intense heat between her thighs, begging for her attention. She wants to start touching herself but with her Mom so close she can't help but feel it is inappropriate.</p>\r\n            }\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\"> She looks over at the mature woman and gasps. She was slowly stroking a quite impressive strapon looking at Kathrine. \"<span className=\"MomSpeak\">Such a good girl, finishing up so quickly. Ready for your morning fuck? I can see that you are dying to be filled, baby.</span>\" She said with a wide smile.</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img src={require(\"../../resources/momStrapon.jpg\")} alt=\"Kathrine's Mom with strapon\" className=\"img-fluid rounded\"/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">Kathrine couldn't bring herself to say no and before she knew it she was bending over the table. Her pussy burning with need. She wanted to get fucked so badly, she didn't care that it was her own mother doing it. Her pussy was dripping with need as she felt the thick rubber cock slide inside of her. It was so wonderful, so thick and powerful. It hit all the right spots as her mother grabbed her by the hips and started to pump. Kathrine moaned and mewled. The wet sound of her juices filling the room. \"<span className=\"MomSpeak\">Mmmh, You are so horny today, sweetie. I can barely keep up with the way you grind your hips!</span>\" The mature woman teased her thrusting becoming harder and harder, hitting Kathrine's sensitive spots with an efficiency that only comes with routine.<br/> It didn't take long before Kathrine howled in joy and her snatch tightened and the orgasm flowed through her. She was panting and groaning. \"<span className=\"MomSpeak\">SHIT! You are gonna be late. You need to get up and get to the bus, sweetie.</span>\" Her mom said before Kathrine knew what was happening she found herself on her way out of the door. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">As late teen made her way to the bus stop she couldn't help but wonder what just happened. She had fucked her own mother, she had been so needy, so horny, and so incredibly ready for it. Her Mom had been so casual about it too. The pen had really done its job and turned the entire world on its head.  Slowly things started to make sense. If women were much hornier than men, then they would probably need to be relieved of stress much more frequent, and if Kathrine's male friends were any indication it was a lot already. Her suspicion was confirmed as even before she reached the bus stop the need to get filled slowly started to spread between her legs.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">As Kathrine got on the bus she was in for another surprise. Inside seemed to be only girls, which in hindsight was natural. With the increased libido any man would probably be raped by the entire bus if he was on it, which would look bad for the school. Every seat seemed to be either equipped by some sort of sex toy or a set of kissing girls. Many was doing much more, it was actually hard to find just one girl who wasn't actively masturbating.</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img src={require(\"../../resources/sexBus.gif\")} alt=\"Masturbation on bus\" className=\" mx-auto d-block rounded\"/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">Kathrine passed by a group of cheerleaders, all of them eagerly helping each other out, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img src={require(\"../../resources/cheerBus.gif\")} alt=\"Cheerleader masturbating\" className=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\"/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\"> Kathrine decided to find a spot in the back of the bus, one without a dildo or vibrator planted in the middle of it. She couldn't help but let a hand slide down between her legs though, and she sighed with glee as she slowly got to mitigate the building need that had started to spread in the last 15 minutes. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-light\">She didn't even get to reach her peak before the bus arrived at the school.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    }else{\r\n        standardText = \r\n        (<div>\r\n            { rules.bigBreasts? \r\n            <div>\r\n                <p className=\"text-light\">As Kathrine finished up her breakfast she couldn't help but yawn.

However next time, try waiting for me to pick you. However, I know what you want.</span>\" The teacher reached down and with a little flick of her button on her desk, a vibrating sound came from Sally's chair.

The reality-warping pen. \"<span className=\"PeachSpeak\">Well the punishment is that the rest of the school gets to know how dumb you are, Kathrine.</span>\" She says, and without even pausing she uses the pen to write \"BIMBO\" on Kathrine's collarbone.

She tried her best to keep up with the class, but it was impossible. She didn't get to feel the vibrations of her seat a single time, while other girls in the class got to explode in pure ecstasy.

Kathrine's tongue started to work, focusing on the hard and wonderful pearl. The raven-haired girl inhaling the scent deeply, taking it in and savouring it. Each breath and lick making Miss Peach moan and gasp. Both of them had lost control, and Kathrine could taste and feel that her teacher was getting close. She must have been dying for an orgasm for her to be this build-up. Kathrine was happy to oblige and as she slurped and licked she could feel herself growing close, just from eating out the mature woman.

She couldn't stop herself from going faster. The pleasure building in her core. She loved this feeling. It was amazing. She wanted more of it. She craved more of it. She felt her legs start to tremble and before she knew it she was cumming.

Maybe she is just pretending to be smart? <br/> The thought seemed to simply stick in her mind, unable to get out. It was so weird. No matter how much she tried the idea that the only reason people thought she was smart was because she knew lots and lots of small pieces of trivia she could spew in the face of people who asked.

A cold sweat ran down her back when she realized that she was starring the answer. She had picked wrong. She could feel the heat spreading in her cheeks. It was surprisingly humiliating, but she didn't give in. Instead, she took a deep breath and tried again. The next answer was also wrong, and as she kept on choosing she felt like she couldn't get any of them right.<br/> She gritted her teeth as she  tried over and over again, every single answer wrong .<br/> When the class ended she sighed in frustration.

After all, Kathrine was quite a clever girl. She blazed through every single one of them, seeing her name slowly rise to the top of the scoreboard. The raven-haired girl couldn't help but feel a smug sense of superiority. Her thumbs moving even faster now that the victory was at hand. She was fast, faster than she would have thought possible, and she couldn't help but imagine herself as the flash, thinking and reacting faster than lightning. She was on fire and as she won she would be carried out by her fellow students, all of them cheering and laughing at her amazing victory. <br/> While the idea was amazing it didn't go quite as planned.
